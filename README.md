# Ruby on Rails Tutorial

## Toy application

This is the second application for the
[*Ruby on Rails Tutorial*](https://www.railstutorial.org/)
by [Michael Hartl](https://www.michaelhartl.com/).

## Purpose

The toy app will consist of users and their associated microposts (thus constituting a minimalist Twitter-style app). 

The functionality will be utterly under-developed - the purpose is to get a high-level overview of Ruby on Rails programming (and web development in general) by rapidly generating an application using scaffold generators, which create a large amount of functionality automatically.

The resulting toy app will allow me to interact with it through its URLs, giving me insight into the structure of a Rails application, including a first example of the REST architecture favored by Rails.
